# Advent Of Code 2021

This is my first year attempting the 'advent of code' challenge at https://adventofcode.com/2021.  Will complete challenges in R (and perhaps Python as well if time permits).

Each daily challenge has a single R file, with a separate code chunk for 'part 1' and 'part 2' respectively.  Some functions and data reading script may be shared between the two parts.  Data for each day is saved in a '.txt' file that is copy and pasted directly from the website.

Some of the code is not the most elegant (I'm focussed on speed coding), suggestions for improvement welcome!
